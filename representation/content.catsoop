# Module 1: Representation

**Representation** is a fundamental concept in computational thinking that addresses how we encode and store information in a way that computers can process. Every piece of data—whether it's a number, a letter, an image, or a sound—must be converted into a format that machines can understand and manipulate.

In this module, you'll explore different ways that information can be represented digitally. You'll discover how simple measurements can be encoded, how images are built from tiny units of color, how different number systems allow us to express quantities in various bases, and how information can be protected through error detection and encryption.

Understanding representation helps us:
- See the connection between the physical world and digital data
- Appreciate how computers "think" about information
- Build intuition for encoding and decoding data
- Understand how data can be protected and secured
