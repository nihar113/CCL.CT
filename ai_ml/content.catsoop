# Module 3: AI & ML

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** are transforming how computers solve problems. Instead of following explicit instructions for every situation, AI systems can reason logically, make decisions based on patterns, and even learn from experience.

In this module, you'll explore the foundational concepts of AI and ML through hands-on unplugged activities. You'll discover how machines can "think" using logic, how they make decisions, and how simple learning mechanisms can lead to surprisingly intelligent behavior.

Understanding AI & ML helps us:
- Recognize how computers can simulate reasoning and learning
- Appreciate both the power and limitations of AI systems
- Think critically about AI in our daily lives
- Build intuition for how machines "learn" from data

## Logical Reasoning

Activities exploring how computers use logic to reason and solve problems:

- [Punched Cards (Logic)](CURRENT/punched_cards_logic) — Use punched cards to implement logical operations and Boolean reasoning

---

## Machine Learning

Activities exploring how machines can learn from experience:

- [Decision Tree Unplugged](CURRENT/decision_tree) — Create and use decision trees to classify objects and make predictions
