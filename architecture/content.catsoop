# Module 4: Architecture

**Computer Architecture** explores the physical building blocks that make computation possible. From ancient calculating tools to modern processors, humans have invented increasingly sophisticated machines to automate calculation and logical reasoning.

In this module, you'll build and explore mechanical and physical computing devices—machines that compute without electricity! These hands-on activities reveal the fundamental principles underlying all computers: arithmetic operations, logic gates, and memory.

Understanding architecture helps us:
- Appreciate the ingenuity behind computing machines
- See how simple components combine to create complex behavior
- Understand that "computation" doesn't require electricity
- Build intuition for how modern computers work at the hardware level

## Calculators and Logic Gates

Activities exploring mechanical and physical devices that perform calculation and logical operations:

- [Slide Adding Machine](CURRENT/slide_adding_machine) — Build a mechanical device that performs addition using sliding mechanisms
- [Paper Computer](CURRENT/paper_computer) — Create a working computer simulation using only paper and manual operations
- [Domino Computer](CURRENT/domino_computer) — Construct logic gates and circuits using falling dominoes
- [Pulley Computer](CURRENT/pulley_computer) — Use pulleys and weights to perform calculations through mechanical advantage

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Trace the history of computing from mechanical devices to modern computers
* Build mechanical devices that perform arithmetic operations
* Construct logic gates using physical materials (dominoes, pulleys, etc.)
* Understand how simple components combine to create computational systems
* Explain the connection between physical mechanisms and digital logic
* Appreciate that computation is about information processing, not just electronics
