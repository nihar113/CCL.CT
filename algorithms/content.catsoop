# Module 2: Algorithms

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. They are the heart of computational thinking—precise instructions that transform inputs into desired outputs. Every time you follow a recipe, give directions, or explain how to do something, you are using algorithmic thinking.

In this module, you'll explore algorithms through hands-on activities that make abstract concepts tangible. You'll discover how computers search for information, sort data efficiently, and solve complex puzzles through systematic approaches.

Understanding algorithms helps us:
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Find efficient solutions to everyday challenges
- Recognize patterns and optimize our approaches
- Think systematically about problem-solving
